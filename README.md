# Advent of Code

Some attempts at the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

I try to structure the notebooks to follow my thinking process. 
I don't clean them up, to keep track of my thinking process, so some of it is probably wrong.
The correct solution, when I found one, should always be in the last few cells.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies
```bash
uv sync --dev
```

2. Copy `.env.dist` to `.env` and fill in the values.
```bash
cp .env.dist .env
```
