# Advent of Code

Some attempts at the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

I try to structure the notebooks to follow my thinking process. 
I don't clean them up, to keep track of my thinking process, so some of it is probably wrong.
The correct solution, when I found one, should always be in the last few cells.

## Setup

```bash
uv sync --dev
```
